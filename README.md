<h2>Past Projects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Neural Network Digit Recognition (Luau)</h3>
    <p>
      This project was a significant milestone in my programming journey. Using Luau on Roblox, I developed a neural network for digit recognition. The project involved implementing various layers of the neural network, training it with digit datasets, and optimizing its performance. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of machine learning concepts and honed my programming skills in Lua.
    </p>

  <li>
    <h3>Global Illumination Simulation (Luau)</h3>
    <p>
      One of my favorite projects, this simulation used ray tracing techniques to simulate natural lighting effects (global illumination) in Luau on Roblox. The project aimed to replicate how light interacts and bounces off surfaces in a realistic manner, enhancing visual fidelity and creating immersive environments. Through this project, I gained practical experience in implementing advanced rendering techniques and honed my skills in Lua programming within the Roblox platform.
    </p>

    <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Python)</h3>
    <p>
      This project aimed to create an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI using advanced algorithms in Python. Implemented with the Minimax algorithm combined with alpha-beta pruning, the AI evaluates all possible moves recursively, maximizing its chances of winning or forcing a draw against any opponent strategy. This project strengthened my understanding of artificial intelligence concepts and enhanced my skills in algorithmic thinking and problem-solving.

    <h3>Random Maze Generator And Solver (Luau)</h3>
    <p>
      Developed in Luau on Roblox, this project combined recursive backtracking for maze generation and A* pathfinding for solving mazes. The generator creates random mazes with varying complexities, ensuring each maze is solvable. The solver navigates through the maze efficiently using A* pathfinding, finding the shortest path while considering obstacles. This project deepened my proficiency in Lua programming and algorithmic design within game development contexts.
