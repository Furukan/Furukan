<h1>About Me:</h1>
Hello, my name is Enis Furkan Yıldız and I'm from Turkey. I've had a interest in programming since 2020. Over the years, I have become proficient in Python and Roblox Luau. In addition to my programming expertise, I have a B2 level English, which allows me to effectively communicate and collaborate internationally. I am continuously expanding my knowledge in the field of software development. I am currently studying at Cumhuriyet Science High School in Turkey.

<h1>Skills And Experiences: </h1>
<p>
  As mentioned earlier, I began programming in 2020, and I now consider myself a proficient developer in Python and Roblox Lua.
  <br>
  I have completed numerous part-time and full-time commissions. I believe myself in developing algorithmic, mathematical, and physics-based software.

<h1>Projects:</h1>
<h2>Neural Network Digit Recognition:</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Maze Generator and Path Finder:</h2>
<p>This project is about <b>Recursive Backtrack</b> and <b>A* Pathfinding</b> which are Maze Generation and Path Finding Algorithms.</p>
<p>This project lets users create their own mazes with custom starting and ending points. They can then watch how the A* Pathfinding Algorithm finds the best path through these mazes.</p>

<p>Users can set maze size and where it begins and ends. The maze-making uses a method called Recursive Backtrack, making sure each maze is unique and solvable. Once a maze is made, users can see how the A* Pathfinding Algorithm finds the shortest route from start to finish.</p>

<p>This project shows how mazes are made and how computers find the best paths. It's helpful for learning and useful in games and other areas where finding paths is important.</p>

<p>After the latest update, this project now allows users to create 3D mazes and visualize pathfinding within them!</p>

<h2>Type Race Game:</h2>
<p>I initially started this project on commission, but I have since discontinued my work on it. However, I have decided to showcase this project here.</p>
<p>In this project, I extensively utilized <i>RemoteFunctions</i> and <i>RemoteEvents</i> to prevent player exploits.</p>

<h2>Graphic Painter:</h2>
<p>This script creates pictures of mathematical functions using smart math rules. It's helpful for seeing how functions work.</p>

<h3>Key Points:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Using Math Rules:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The script uses smart rules to make accurate pictures of math functions.</li>
      <li>It shows curves, slopes, and where functions cross or go near straight lines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Easy to Use:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You can change the numbers and see how the pictures change in real-time.</li>
      <li>It's simple to use and helps you learn how math functions look.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Helps Learning:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Good for teachers, students, and researchers to explain tricky math ideas.</li>
      <li>Makes it easier to understand math by showing it with pictures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Where It's Used:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Used in schools, research, and for understanding data better.</li>
      <li>Shows how math works visually, which is important for many jobs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
