    <h4>Roblox Lua: Advanced (4 Years)</h4>
    <p>
      Since 2020, I have been deeply involved in Roblox Lua development, focusing on creating immersive gameplay experiences and intricate game mechanics. I started with basic scripting and gradually advanced to more complex projects involving event handling, object-oriented programming, and optimization techniques. My projects range from interactive simulations to multiplayer games, where I've implemented systems for character controls, game physics, and user interfaces. This journey has not only honed my Lua programming skills but also enhanced my understanding of game development principles and player engagement.

<h2>Past Projects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Neural Network Digit Recognition (Luau)</h3>
    <p>
      This project represents a significant milestone in my programming journey. I developed a neural network for digit recognition using Luau on Roblox. The project involved implementing various layers of the neural network, training it with digit datasets, and optimizing its performance. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of machine learning concepts and honed my programming skills in Lua. It was a rewarding experience to see the neural network accurately recognize digits based on input data.

    <h3>Global Illumination Simulation (Luau)</h3>
    <p>
      One of my favorite projects, this simulation involves sending a RayCast from the sun and using ray tracing techniques to simulate natural lighting effects, known as global illumination. The project aims to replicate how light interacts and bounces off surfaces in a realistic manner, enhancing visual fidelity and creating immersive environments. Through this project, I gained practical experience in implementing advanced rendering techniques and honed my skills in Lua programming within the Roblox platform.
    </p>

    <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Python)</h3>
    <p>
      This is also one of my favorite projects, the Tic-Tac-Toe AI aims to create an unbeatable player using advanced algorithms. Implemented in Python, this project utilizes the Minimax algorithm combined with alpha-beta pruning to ensure optimal moves in every game scenario. The AI evaluates all possible moves recursively, maximizing its chances of winning or forcing a draw against any opponent strategy. This project not only strengthened my understanding of artificial intelligence concepts but also enhanced my skills in algorithmic thinking and problem-solving.

    <h3>Random Maze Generator And Solver (Luau)</h3>
    <p>
      Developed in Luau on Roblox, this project combines recursive backtracking for maze generation and A* pathfinding for solving mazes. The generator creates random mazes with varying complexities, ensuring each maze is solvable. The solver navigates through the maze efficiently using A* pathfinding, finding the shortest path while considering obstacles. This project deepened my proficiency in Lua programming and algorithmic design within game development contexts. <br><br>
      <i>I also published this project as an open-source module: <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/mazemodule-create-mazes-and-find-your-way/3014919">Maze Module (DevForum)</a></i>
